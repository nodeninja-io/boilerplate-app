        h3 Why did I have to login to see this page?
        p
          | Because authentication is a primary aspect of this boilerplate application. And without authenticating you wouldn't 
          | get to experience all these amazing features to help jumpstart your next project: 
      
          ul
            li Email traffic on (signup, account change, password reset, etc.)
            li Administrative features
            li User account management
            li Ability to connect/disconnect your favorite social accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Google and Github)
            li Enhanced security with two-factor authentication that you can turn on/off in your profile!
            li A whole slew of API's that will be helpful in building your next application
            li Real-time user tracking using socket.io

        h3 So what cool technology is used with NodeNinja?
        p
          | Just as NodeNinja is Open Source, so are the components that weave together the boilerplate application. Here are just a few technologies you should familiarize yourself with:
          ul
            li Core Technolgy Stack (Node.js, MongoDB, Jade, Express)
            li Other Server Technology (Passport, Async, Socket.io, NodeMailer, Helmet, Winston, express-validator, express-flash). 
            li Client Technology (Bootstrap, Font-Awesome, jQuery, Moment.js)
            li Development (Bower, Gulp, JSHint, JSCS, Nodemon)
            li We have also included Node.js cluster support
        
        br
        p The application design is modeled using a MVC project structure. 
          ul
            li Views are the Jade Templates
            li Models are the Mongo/Mongoose models
            li Controllers are used for routing, page logic and data access via the models

        br
        p (<strong>NOTE:</strong> In this demo all users are setup as administrators. Normally they would just be a "user" and the Admin menu would not be accessible or visible.)
